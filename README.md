## 🌟 Overview

This project is an interactive handwritten digit classification web application built on the MNIST dataset.

Users can upload a digit image and instantly receive:

- 🎯 The predicted digit (0–9)  
- 📊 Full probability distribution  
- 🖼️ A preview of the uploaded image

The user interface features a clean, modern two-column layout with gradients, animations, and soft glow effects for a premium experience.

## 🧠 Model Evolution

### 🔹 Step 1 — Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
The project began with a simple MLP classifier to establish a baseline understanding of MNIST classification.

### 🔹 Step 2 — Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
The final deployed model is a CNN trained on MNIST, which offers significantly higher accuracy and better generalization.

CNN advantages:

- Learns spatial features (strokes, edges, shapes)  
- Provides more reliable predictions  
- Produces smoother probability distributions  
- Outperforms MLP on both train and test accuracy
